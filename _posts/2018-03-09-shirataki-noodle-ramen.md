##### Ingredients

###### Broth

* 1 cup of Chicken Broth
* 2 Cups of Water
* 2 Tablespoons of Soy sauce
* 1 Tablespoon of Sriracha Sauce
* 2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil
* 2 Tablespoons of Sesame Oil
* 2 Tablespoons of Butter
* Garlic Powder to taste
* Ground Ginger to taste
* 1 Scallion
* Red pepper flakes to taste

###### Others

* 1 Egg
* 68g of Broccoli
* 6oz of precooked shrimp
* 1 package of Shirataki Noodles (Angle hair)


##### Directions

###### Prepare Broth

* Combine all broth ingredients in a medium-sized saucepan and let simmer on low or medium-low heat. I usually let cook for about 20 minutes. Stir periodically. Do not let boil.

###### Prepare Noodles

* Open the bag and drain all the water through a colander.
*  Rinse the noodles for roughly 5 minutes. The goal is to get as much as the water it is packaged with off.
*  Have a small pot of salt water boiling and boil the noodles for 2-3 minutes.
*  Strain noodles with a colander and rinse with cold water.
*  Place noodles on a paper towel for a few seconds to absorb any extra water.
*  Place noodles in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Move the noodles around constantly and once the noodles start "squeaking" they are done.

###### Final Steps

* Add Shrimp, Noodles, Broccoli and Egg (poach it) to the broth.
* Continue to cook for another 5-10 minutes or until the Egg is cooked on medium-low to medium heat. Done!

##### Notes

* DO NOT PUT BUTTER ON THE SKILLET WHILE PREPPING NOODLES. The goal is to remove as much moisture from the noodles as possible.
* Noodles can be subbed with normal noodles for non-keto recipe
* Broccoli can also be added to the broth early but that makes it become mushy
